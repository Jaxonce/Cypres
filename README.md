# A propos

The genesis of the idea of Cyprès started from two observations, the first is social: today the
Travel and opportunities to live abroad are made more and more possible and easier.
The second observation concerns the functioning of other social networks, in fact all these
Applications always offer a single space for a single functionality. For example, we
we generally group all our conversations in the same place, even if it means having to mix them all up
the types of relationships we have (family, professional, etc.).
Our goal was to find a way to maintain a strong social bond with our loved ones within the framework
of a long distance relationship. For this we have imagined an application allowing you to create a
space shared between 2 users, giving them a feeling of proximity and sharing.
This common space is made up of several sections, each of which has the role of bringing together
digital content connecting the 2 people. This operation aims to really highlight the
complicity and intimacy, the different types of relationships being well separated.
